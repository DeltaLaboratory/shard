## Query Syntax Explanation

### Top-level Structure
The overall syntax consists of a query followed by a space and a key clause:
```
syntax = query, space, key_clause ;
```

### Query Clause
A query starts with the keyword "QUERY", followed by a space, an opening parenthesis, a list of fields, and a closing parenthesis:
```
query = "QUERY", space, "(", field_list, ")" ;
```

### Field List
The field list is composed of one or more fields, separated by commas:
```
field_list = field, { comma, field } ;
```

### Individual Field
Each field is represented by an identifier:
```
field = identifier ;
```

### Key Clause
The key clause consists of the keyword "KEY", a space, and a key value:
```
key_clause = "KEY", space, key_value ;
```

### Basic Elements
- **Identifier**: Starts with a letter, followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores.
- **Key Value**: Same format as an identifier.
- **Letter**: Any uppercase or lowercase letter from A to Z.
- **Digit**: Any number from 0 to 9.
- **Underscore**: The "_" character.
- **Space**: One or more space characters.
- **Comma**: A comma, optionally followed by a space.

This EBNF grammar defines a syntax for queries with a variable number of fields and a key. An example of a valid syntax would be:
```
QUERY (field1, field2, field3) KEY mykey
```
